About this program
--------------------
This is a QR code scanner project using HTC Vive's front camera. To use it, you need to put on a HTC Vive and put the phone close to the HMD front camera so that you can see the QR code on your phone very clearly in the HMD. The decoded QR code will be shown in front of you.
